# HMI-AR-segmentation
This repository contains the code used in the bachelor project 'Feature Extraction from Full Disk Solar Images using Morphological Operations and Machine Learning'.
We used thresholding methods like multiple Otsu, morphological filters, feature extraction and K-means clustering to segment and classify active regions from HMI magnetograms from the SDOMLv2 dataset.
